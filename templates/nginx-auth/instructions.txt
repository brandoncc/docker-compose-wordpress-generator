Nginx Basic Auth
----------------

If you would like to enable basic auth, follow these steps (requires a local
machine with `htpasswd` installed):

1. Open a terminal
2. Change directory to __PROJECT_DIRECTORY__/nginx-auth
3. Run `htpasswd -c .htpasswd user-name`
  - user-name is the username you would like to use for basic auth
  - if you have already used this command, omit the -c to add users to an
    existing .htpasswd file
4. Enter the desired password twice
5. Run the generator again: `ruby __GENERATOR_FILE__ __PROJECT_DIRECTORY__/generator-settings.yml`
6. Copy the contents of __PROJECT_DIRECTORY__ to __SERVER_DIRECTORY__ on the
   server again
7. SSH into the server, and change to the __SERVER_DIRECTORY__ directory
8. Run `docker-compose up --force-recreate -d webserver` (this copies the new auth
   config to the docker container, and sets the correct file permissions)
9. Access the website to verify that the basic auth is functioning as expected
